 Paneer is prepared by adding food acid, such as lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid or yogurt, to hot milk to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are drained in muslin or cheesecloth and the excess water is pressed out. The resulting paneer is dipped in chilled water for 2â€“3 hours to improve its texture and appearance. From this point, the preparation of paneer diverges based on its use and regional tradition.
